# Java Programing

##### _Invented by James Gosling (1995)_

---

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

**Java is also used in multiple ways for example:**

1. Social Media
2. Big data and Hadoop
3. Android Application Development
4. Data Science and AI
5. Data Security
6. Software Testing
7. Data Analytics

**Features of Java:**

1. Open source
2. High Performance (in-time Compiler)
3. Multithreaded
4. Secured
5. Platform Independent (Java compiled into bytecode)
6. Portable
7. Object Oriented
8. Robust

**Code running in two steps**

1. Compilation
2. Execution

_JRE (Java Runtime Environment) component in JDK_

_JVM (Java Virtual Machine) component in JRE_

**Example of print** _Hello World_ **in Java:**

```
public class FirstClass {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        System.out.print("Hello World");
    }
}

public means that the method will be visible from classes in other packages. static means that the
method is not attached to a specific instance, and it has no " this ". It is more or less a function.
void is the return type. It means "this method returns nothing".
```
